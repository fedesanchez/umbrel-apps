description: >-
    Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. We're building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade open source tools.

    Supabase is a combination of open source tools. Weâ€™re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. 
    If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. 
    If the tool doesn't exist, we build and open source it ourselves. 

    Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.

    Supabase is a hosted platform. You can sign up and start using Supabase without installing anything. You can also self-host and develop locally.


    -   Postgres is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

    -   Realtime is an Elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts, updates, and deletes using websockets. Realtime polls Postgres' built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over websockets to authorized clients.

    -   PostgREST is a web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API

    -   GoTrue is a JWT based API for managing users and issuing JWT tokens.

    -   Storage provides a RESTful interface for managing Files stored in S3, using Postgres to manage permissions.

    -   pg_graphql a PostgreSQL extension that exposes a GraphQL API

    -   postgres-meta is a RESTful API for managing your Postgres, allowing you to fetch tables, add roles, and run queries, etc.
